Sergeant Gerry Boyle is an eccentric small-town cop with a confrontational and crass personality and a subversive sense of humor. A longtime policeman in County Galway, Boyle is a maverick with his own moral code. He has seen enough of the world to know there isn't much to it and has had plenty of time to think about it. When a fellow police officer disappears and Boyle's small town becomes key to a large drug trafficking investigation, he is forced to at least feign interest when dealing with the humorless FBI agent Wendell Everett assigned to the case.",1.3098672828225537,"UK Film Council, Crescendo Productions, Element Pictures, Irish Film Board, Prescience, Reprisal Films, Aegis Film Fund",Ireland,2011-07-07,7.291374956287113,1.9867717342662448,"Gaeilge, English",Released,The FBI are about to discover that things work a little differently around here.,The Guard,6.8,2.571708831808688,67913,"Brendan Gleeson, Don Cheadle, Liam Cunningham, Mark Strong, Katarina Cas, David Wilmot, Rory Keenan, Laurence Kinlan, Dominique McElligott, Sarah Greene, Fionnula Flanagan, Gary Lydon, Mark O'Halloran, David Pearse",1,1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Talking heads yelling from every TV camera blame everything from Satan to video games. But are we that much different from many other countries? What sets us apart? How have we become both the master and victim of such enormous amounts of violence? This is not a film about gun control. It is a film about the fearful heart and soul of the United States, and the 280 million Americans lucky enough to have the right to a constitutionally protected Uzi. From a look at the Columbine High School security camera tapes to the home of Oscar-winning NRA President Charlton Heston, from a young man who makes homemade napalm with The Anarchist's Cookbook to the murder of a six-year-old girl by another six-year-old, Bowling for Columbine is a journey through America, through our past, hoping to discover why our pursuit of happiness is so riddled with violence.",1.0939412317709865,"Alliance Atlantis Communications, TiMe Film- und TV-Produktions GmbH, Vif Babelsberger Filmproduktion GmbH & Co.
