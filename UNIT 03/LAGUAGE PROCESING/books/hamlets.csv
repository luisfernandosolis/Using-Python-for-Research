        But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion
  This boades some strange erruption to our State

    Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch
        So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land
         And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon
       And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre
Why such impresse of Shipwrights whose sore Taske
         Dos not diuide the Sunday from the weeke
       What might be toward that this sweaty hast
   Doth make the Night ioyntLabourer with the day
                      Who ist that can informe me
                                   Hor That can I
       At least the whisper goes so Our last King
           Whose Image euen but now appeard to vs
          Was as you know by Fortinbras of Norway
        Thereto prickd on by a most emulate Pride
  Dard to the Combate In which our Valiant Hamlet
 For so this side of our knowne world esteemd him
  Did slay this Fortinbras who by a Seald Compact
               Well ratified by Law and Heraldrie
   Did forfeite with his life all those his Lands
         Which he stood seizd on to the Conqueror
              Against the which a Moity competent
          Was gaged by our King which had returnd
                 To the Inheritance of Fortinbras
     Had he bin Vanquisher as by the same Counant
              And carriage of the Article designe
      His fell to Hamlet Now sir young Fortinbras
                Of vnimproued Mettle hot and full
     Hath in the skirts of Norway heere and there
          Sharkd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes
            For Foode and Diet to some Enterprize
       That hath a stomacke int which is no other
          And it doth well appeare vnto our State
              But to recouer of vs by strong hand
     And termes Compulsatiue those foresaid Lands
         So by his Father lost and this I take it
          Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations
 The Sourse of this our Watch and the cheefe head
          Of this posthast and Romage in the Land
                               Enter Ghost againe
        But soft behold Loe where it comes againe
   Ile crosse it though it blast me Stay Illusion
           If thou hast any sound or vse of Voyce
Speake to me If there be any good thing to be ...
That may to thee do ease and grace to me speak...
          If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate
    Which happily foreknowing may auoyd Oh speake
            Or if thou hast vphoorded in thy life
          Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth
For which they say you Spirits oft walke in death
   Speake of it Stay and speake Stop it Marcellus
        Mar Shall I strike at it with my Partizan
                      Hor Do if it will not stand
                                   Barn Tis heere
                                    Hor Tis heere

                                       Exit Ghost
              We do it wrong being so Maiesticall
                 To offer it the shew of Violence
               For it is as the Ayre invulnerable
           And our vaine blowes malicious Mockery
   Barn It was about to speake when the Cocke ...
      Hor And then it started like a guilty thing
             Vpon a fearfull Summons I haue heard
         The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day
   Doth with his lofty and shrillsounding Throate
          Awake the God of Day and at his warning
          Whether in Sea or Fire in Earth or Ayre
            Th extrauagant and erring Spirit hyes
          To his Confine And of the truth heerein
               This present Obiect made probation
         Mar It faded on the crowing of the Cocke
    Some sayes that euer gainst that Season comes
         Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated
       The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long
     And then they say no Spirit can walke abroad
   The nights are wholsome then no Planets strike
  No Faiery talkes nor Witch hath power to Charme
           So hallowd and so gracious is the time
    Hor So haue I heard and do in part beleeue it
        But looke the Morne in Russet mantle clad
     Walkes ore the dew of yon high Easterne Hill
          Breake we our Watch vp and by my aduice
        Let vs impart what we haue seene to night
                Vnto yong Hamlet For vpon my life
       This Spirit dumbe to vs will speake to him
     Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it
        As needfull in our Loues fitting our Duty

              To be contracted in one brow of woe
  Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature
         That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him

    Therefore our sometimes Sister now our Queene
    Th imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State
             Haue we as twere with a defeated ioy
         With one Auspicious and one Dropping eye

     Your better Wisedomes which haue freely gone

        That shall not be my Offer not thy Asking
         The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart
         The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth
     Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father
                   What wouldst thou haue Laertes
                               Laer Dread my Lord
       Your leaue and fauour to returne to France
  From whence though willingly I came to Denmarke
               To shew my duty in your Coronation
           Yet now I must confesse that duty done
My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France
   And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon

         Ham Not so my Lord I am too much ith Sun
    Queen Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off
And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke
             Do not for euer with thy veyled lids
           Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust
   Thou knowst tis common all that liues must dye
               Passing through Nature to Eternity
                         Ham I Madam it is common
                                   Queen If it be
            Why seemes it so particular with thee
     Ham Seemes Madam Nay it is I know not Seemes
         Tis not alone my Inky Cloake good Mother
           Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke
            Nor windy suspiration of forcd breath
            No nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye
           Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage
  Together with all Formes Moods shewes of Griefe
      That can denote me truly These indeed Seeme
       For they are actions that a man might play
        But I haue that Within which passeth show
    These but the Trappings and the Suites of woe
                   King Tis sweet and commendable
                            In your Nature Hamlet
     To giue these mourning duties to your Father
      But you must know your Father lost a Father
 That Father lost lost his and the Suruiuer bound
             In filiall Obligation for some terme
          To do obsequious Sorrow But to perseuer
             In obstinate Condolement is a course
      Of impious stubbornnesse Tis vnmanly greefe
        It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen
            A Heart vnfortified a Minde impatient
            An Vnderstanding simple and vnschoold
        For what we know must be and is as common
            As any the most vulgar thing to sence
          Why should we in our peeuish Opposition
       Take it to heart Fye tis a fault to Heauen
       A fault against the Dead a fault to Nature
        To Reason most absurd whose common Theame
     Is death of Fathers and who still hath cried
   From the first Coarse till he that dyed to day
       This must be so We pray you throw to earth
           This vnpreuayling woe and thinke of vs
       As of a Father For let the world take note
         You are the most immediate to our Throne
               And with no lesse Nobility of Loue
  Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne
          Do I impart towards you For your intent
          In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg
              It is most retrograde to our desire
           And we beseech you bend you to remaine
       Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye
        Our cheefest Courtier Cosin and our Sonne
    Qu Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet
      I prythee stay with vs go not to Wittenberg

           Be as our selfe in Denmarke Madam come
         This gentle and vnforcd accord of Hamlet

             So excellent a King that was to this
      Hiperion to a Satyre so louing to my Mother
   That he might not beteene the windes of heauen
      Visit her face too roughly Heauen and Earth
        Must I remember why she would hang on him
            As if encrease of Appetite had growne
         By what is fed on and yet within a month
  Let me not thinke ont Frailty thy name is woman
      A little Month or ere those shooes were old
    With which she followed my poore Fathers body
           Like Niobe all teares Why she euen she
  O Heauen A beast that wants discourse of Reason
 Would haue mournd longer married with mine Vnkle
    My Fathers Brother but no more like my Father
               Then I to Hercules Within a Moneth
      Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares
         Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes
          She married O most wicked speed to post
         With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets
             It is not nor it cannot come to good
    But breake my heart for I must hold my tongue
             Enter Horatio Barnardo and Marcellus

       And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch
       The vertue of his feare but you must feare
   His greatnesse weighd his will is not his owne
         For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth
             Hee may not as vnuallued persons doe

       The sanctity and health of the whole State

        Feare it Ophelia feare it my deare Sister
     And keepe within the reare of your Affection

            The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough
           If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone

       The Canker Galls the Infants of the Spring
           Too oft before the buttons be disclosd
         And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth
          Contagious blastments are most imminent

  Youth to it selfe rebels though none else neere

   Himselfe the Primrose path of dalliance treads
                     And reaks not his owne reade

           Of entrance to a quarrell but being in

 Take each mans censure but reserue thy iudgement
            Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy

          For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man
 And they in France of the best ranck and station
  Are of a most select and generous cheff in that
               Neither a borrower nor a lender be
      For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend
         And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry

      The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene
           Oh Hamlet what a falling off was there
           From me whose loue was of that dignity
      That it went hand in hand euen with the Vow

     But soft me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre
    Briefe let me be Sleeping within mine Orchard
             My custome alwayes in the afternoone
             Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole
          With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl
       And in the Porches of mine eares did poure
            The leaperous Distilment whose effect
           Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man
     That swift as Quicksiluer it courses through
        The naturall Gates and Allies of the body
         And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset
         And curd like Aygre droppings into Milke
       The thin and wholsome blood so did it mine
             And a most instant Tetter bakd about
     Most Lazarlike with vile and loathsome crust
                               All my smooth Body
           Thus was I sleeping by a Brothers hand
   Of Life of Crowne and Queene at once dispatcht
        Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne
                 Vnhouzzled disappointed vnnaneld
         No reckoning made but sent to my account
             With all my imperfections on my head
            Oh horrible Oh horrible most horrible
         If thou hast nature in thee beare it not
            Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be
             A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest
             But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act
    Taint not thy mind nor let thy Soule contriue
     Against thy Mother ought leaue her to heauen
    And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge
   To pricke and sting her Fare thee well at once
      The Glowworme showes the Matine to be neere
           And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire
                     Adue adue Hamlet remember me

           In this distracted Globe Remember thee
                  Yea from the Table of my Memory
          Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records
 All sawes of Bookes all formes all presures past

         And thy Commandment all alone shall liue

 That they doe know my sonne Come you more neerer

       Polon At closes in the consequence I marry
     He closes with you thus I know the Gentleman
                I saw him yesterday or tother day
Or then or then with such and such and as you say
     There was he gaming there oretooke ins Rouse
         There falling out at Tennis or perchance
            I saw him enter such a house of saile
     Videlicet a Brothell or so forth See you now
   Your bait of falshood takes this Cape of truth
         And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach
         With windlesses and with assaies of Bias
             By indirections finde directions out
               So by my former Lecture and aduice

                 How now Ophelia whats the matter
     Ophe Alas my Lord I haue beene so affrighted
            Polon With what in the name of Heauen
       Ophe My Lord as I was sowing in my Chamber
         Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbracd
         No hat vpon his head his stockings fould
          Vngartred and downe giued to his Anckle
  Pale as his shirt his knees knocking each other
           And with a looke so pitious in purport
             As if he had been loosed out of hell
          To speake of horrors he comes before me

                               Polon What said he
   Ophe He tooke me by the wrist and held me hard
       Then goes he to the length of all his arme
        And with his other hand thus ore his brow
              He fals to such perusall of my face
             As he would draw it Long staid he so
            At last a little shaking of mine Arme
     And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe
         He raisd a sigh so pittious and profound
       That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke
       And end his being That done he lets me goe
       And with his head ouer his shoulders turnd
       He seemd to finde his way without his eyes
       For out adores he went without their helpe
         And to the last bended their light on me
      Polon Goe with me I will goe seeke the King
                 This is the very extasie of Loue
         Whose violent property foredoes it selfe
     And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings
               As oft as any passion vnder Heauen
        That does afflict our Natures I am sorrie
   What haue you giuen him any hard words of late
      Ophe No my good Lord but as you did command
              I did repell his Letters and denyde
                                His accesse to me
                       Pol That hath made him mad
 I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement
   I had not quoted him I feare he did but trifle
And meant to wracke thee but beshrew my iealousie
             It seemes it is as proper to our Age
        To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions
              As it is common for the yonger sort
       To lacke discretion Come go we to the King
  This must be knowne being kept close might moue
      More greefe to hide then hate to vtter loue

      Ham To be or not to be that is the Question
        Whether tis Nobler in the minde to suffer
     The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune
       Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles
        And by opposing end them to dye to sleepe
            No more and by a sleepe to say we end
   The Heartake and the thousand Naturall shockes
       That Flesh is heyre too Tis a consummation
            Deuoutly to be wishd To dye to sleepe
   To sleepe perchance to Dreame I theres the rub
For in that sleepe of death what dreames may come
     When we haue shuffeld off this mortall coile
            Must giue vs pawse Theres the respect
              That makes Calamity of so long life
For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time
    The Oppressors wrong the poore mans Contumely
       The pangs of disprizd Loue the Lawes delay
          The insolence of Office and the Spurnes
         That patient merit of the vnworthy takes
          When he himselfe might his Quietus make
 With a bare Bodkin Who would these Fardles beare
            To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life
      But that the dread of something after death
       The vndiscouered Countrey from whose Borne
            No Traueller returnes Puzels the will
    And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue
          Then flye to others that we know not of
      Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all
            And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution
    Is sicklied ore with the pale cast of Thought
         And enterprizes of great pith and moment
       With this regard their Currants turne away
        And loose the name of Action Soft you now

   King I do beleeue you Think what now you speak
           But what we do determine oft we breake
              Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie

          Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run

           It hath the primall eldest curse vpont
                A Brothers murther Pray can I not
          Though inclination be as sharpe as will
       My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent
         And like a man to double businesse bound
       I stand in pause where I shall first begin
        And both neglect what if this cursed hand
   Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood
   Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens
    To wash it white as Snow Whereto serues mercy
            But to confront the visage of Offence
       And whats in Prayer but this twofold force
            To be forestalled ere we come to fall
         Or pardond being downe Then Ile looke vp
     My fault is past But oh what forme of Prayer
   Can serue my turne Forgiue me my foule Murther

     Of those effects for which I did the Murther
       My Crowne mine owne Ambition and my Queene

          In the corrupted currants of this world

            Why to a publike count I might not go
  Is the great loue the generall gender beare him
    Who dipping all his Faults in their affection
 Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone
   Conuert his Gyues to Graces So that my Arrowes
         Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde
             Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe

     Kin To thine owne peace if he be now returnd
     As checking at his Voyage and that he meanes
         No more to vndertake it I will worke him
              To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice
     Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall
 And for his death no winde of blame shall breath
  But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice
      And call it accident Some two Monthes hence
                 Here was a Gentleman of Normandy
  Iue seene my selfe and serud against the French
 And they ran well on Horsebacke but this Gallant
         Had witchcraft int he grew into his Seat
     And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse
          As had he beene encorpst and demyNaturd
 With the braue Beast so farre he past my thought
          That I in forgery of shapes and trickes
                        Come short of what he did

             For Art and exercise in your defence
               And for your Rapier most especiall
       That he cryed out twould be a sight indeed
    If one could match you Sir This report of his
              Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy
     That he could nothing doe but wish and begge
        Your sodaine comming ore to play with him
                                  Now out of this
                     Laer Why out of this my Lord
         Kin Laertes was your Father deare to you
         Or are you like the painting of a sorrow
                           A face without a heart
                           Laer Why aske you this
  Kin Not that I thinke you did not loue your ...
            But that I know Loue is begun by Time
             And that I see in passages of proofe
         Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it
      Hamlet comes backe what would you vndertake
     To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed
                               More then in words
                Laer To cut his throat ith Church
     Kin No place indeed should murder Sancturize
   Reuenge should haue no bounds but good Laertes
Will you doe this keepe close within your Chamber
      Hamlet returnd shall know you are come home
   Weel put on those shall praise your excellence
             And set a double varnish on the fame
The Frenchman gaue you bring you in fine together
         And wager on your heads he being remisse
       Most generous and free from all contriuing
     Will not peruse the Foiles So that with ease
        Or with a little shuffling you may choose
      A Sword vnbaited and in a passe of practice
                       Requit him for your Father
                                 Laer I will doot
        And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword
             I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke
              So mortall I but dipt a knife in it
      Where it drawes blood no Cataplasme so rare
      Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue
    Vnder the Moone can saue the thing from death
  That is but scratcht withall Ile touch my point
  With this contagion that if I gall him slightly
                                  It may be death

   Twere better not assaid therefore this Proiect

    I hat when in your motion you are hot and dry
       As make your bowts more violent to the end
 And that he cals for drinke Ile haue prepard him
     A Challice for the nonce whereon but sipping

                                          Wer da?
                                       Francisco.
 Nein, gebt Antwort: Halt, und sagt wer ihr seyd.
                                        Bernardo.
                             Lang lebe der König!
                                       Francisco.
                               Seyd ihr Bernardo?
                                        Bernardo.
                                       Er selbst.
                                       Francisco.
       Ihr kommt recht pünktlich auf eure Stunde.
                                        Bernardo.
Es hat eben zwölfe geschlagen; geh du zu Bette...
                                       Francisco.

                                        Bernardo.
               Habt ihr eine ruhige Wache gehabt?
                                       Francisco.
                  Es hat sich keine Maus gerührt.
                                        Bernardo.

                                         Horatio.
                        Freunde von diesem Lande.
                                       Marcellus.
              Und Vasallen des Königs der Dähnen.
                                       Francisco.
                Ich wünsche euch eine gute Nacht.

            Bernardo hat meinen Plaz; gute Nacht.
                                    (Er geht ab.)
                                       Marcellus.
                               Holla, Bernardo!--
                                        Bernardo.
                        He, wie, ist das Horatio?
          Horatio. (Indem er ihm die Hand reicht)
                                Ein Stük von ihm.
                                        Bernardo.
Willkommen, Horatio; willkommen, wakrer Marcel...
                                       Marcellus.
Sagt, hat sich dieses Ding diese Nacht wieder ...
                                        Bernardo.
                                  Ich sah nichts.
                                       Marcellus.

                                         Horatio.
            Gut, gut; es wird nicht wiederkommen.
                                        Bernardo.

                                         Horatio.

                                       Marcellus.
                                 Es ist unwillig.
                                        Bernardo.
                      Seht!  es schreitet hinweg.
                                         Horatio.
            Steh; rede; ich beschwöre dich, rede!
                             (Der Geist geht ab.)
                                       Marcellus.
            Es ist weg, und will nicht antworten.
                                        Bernardo.
Was sagt ihr nun, Horatio?  Ihr zittert und se...

                                         Horatio.

                                       Marcellus.
                     Gleicht es nicht dem Könige?
                                         Horatio.

  Soll ich mit meiner Partisane darnach schlagen?
                                         Horatio.
               Thu es, wenn es nicht stehen will.
                                        Bernardo.

                          Heil, Gnädigster Prinz!
                                          Hamlet.

                             Ja, Gnädigster Herr.
                                          Hamlet.
 Ich bin erfreut euch zu sehen; guten Morgen, Sir

                               Wo, Gnädiger Herr?
                                          Hamlet.
            In den Augen meines Gemüths, Horatio.
                                         Horatio.
Ich sah ihn einmal; er war ein stattlicher Fürst.
                                          Hamlet.

                                          Hamlet.
                             Du sahest ihn?  Wen?
                                         Horatio.
                          Den König, euern Vater.
                                          Hamlet.
                         Den König, meinen Vater?
                                         Horatio.

                                          Hamlet.
          Um des Himmels willen, laß michs hören.
                                         Horatio.

                             Und wo geschahe das?
                                         Horatio.

                    Das ist was sehr Wunderbares!
                                         Horatio.

                                          Hamlet.
In der That, ihr Herren, ich muß es bekennen, ...
                                        hierüber.
                     (Zu Marcellus und Bernardo.)
                  Habt ihr die Wache diese Nacht?
                                           Beyde.
                               Ja, Gnädiger Herr.
                                          Hamlet.
                      Es war bewaffnet, sagt ihr?
                                           Beyde.
                        Bewaffnet, Gnädiger Herr.
                                          Hamlet.
                                 Von Fuß zu Kopf?
                                           Beyde.
                               Ja, Gnädiger Herr.
                                          Hamlet.
      So konntet ihr ja sein Gesicht nicht sehen?
                                         Horatio.
O ja, Gnädiger Herr; er trug sein Visier aufge...
                                          Hamlet.
                 Sagt mir, sah er ungehalten aus?
                                         Horatio.

                                          Hamlet.
                                Bleich oder roth?
                                         Horatio.
                                     Sehr bleich.
                                          Hamlet.
                     Und sah er euch ins Gesicht?
                                         Horatio.
                                      Sehr starr.
                                          Hamlet.
          Ich wollte, daß ich dabey gewesen wäre.
                                         Horatio.
Es würde euch in kein geringes Schreken gesezt...
                                          Hamlet.
                Sehr vermuthlich; blieb es lange?
                                         Horatio.
So lange man brauchte, um mit mässiger Geschwi...

                                           Beyde.
                                  Länger, Länger.
                                         Horatio.
                           Als ich es sah, nicht.
                                          Hamlet.
                      War sein Bart grau?  Nein--
                                         Horatio.

                                         Horatio.
             Ich bin euch gut dafür, das wird es.

                                        Polonius.
              Was sagte er denn zu euch, Ophelia?

                                  Siebende Scene.
(Verwandelt sich in die Terrasse vor dem Palast.)

                                          Hamlet.
                          Wie viel ist die Gloke?
                                         Horatio.

                                       Marcellus.

                           geht ja nicht mit ihm.
               Horatio (Den Hamlet zurükhaltend.)
                Nein, um alles in der Welt nicht.
                                          Hamlet.
Weil es nicht reden will, so will ich ihm folgen.
                                         Horatio.
                   Das thut nicht, Gnädiger Herr.

                                          Hamlet.

                                          Hamlet.

                  Nein, ihr würdet es ausbringen.
                                         Horatio.
           Ich nicht, Gnädiger Herr, beym Himmel!
                                       Marcellus.
                   Ich auch nicht, Gnädiger Herr.
                                          Hamlet.
Nun, sagt mir denn einmal, könnte sich ein Men...

                                           Beyde.
                  Ja, beym Himmel, Gnädiger Herr.

                       Was ist es, Gnädiger Herr?
                                          Hamlet.
Saget niemanden nichts von dem, was ihr heute ...
                                           Beyde.
                  Wir versprechen es Euer Gnaden.
                                          Hamlet.
   Das ist nicht genug, ihr müßt mirs zuschwören.
                                         Horatio.
Auf meine Treu, Gnädiger Herr, ich will nichts...
                                       Marcellus.
 Ich auch nicht, Gnädiger Herr, bey meiner Treue.
                                          Hamlet.
                       Schwört auf mein Schwerdt.
                                       Marcellus.
    Wir haben ja schon geschworen, Gnädiger Herr.
                                          Hamlet.

                                          Hamlet.
Ha, ha, Junge, sagst du das?  Bist du noch da?...
  hört ja was der Bursche dahinten sagt--Schwört!
                                         Horatio.
   Was sollen wir dann beschwören, Gnädiger Herr?
                                          Hamlet.

                  (Ein Zimmer in Polonius Hause.)
              (Polonius und Reinoldo treten auf.)
                                        Polonius.
      Übergieb ihm dieses Geld und diese Papiere.
                                        Reinoldo.
        Ich werde nicht ermangeln, Gnädiger Herr.
                                        Polonius.
Es würde überaus klug von euch gehandelt seyn,...
wenn ihr euch vorher, eh ihr zu ihm geht, nach...
                               erkundigen würdet.
                                        Reinoldo.
         Das war auch mein Vorsaz, Gnädiger Herr.
                                        Polonius.

                                        Polonius.

                 Als wie Spielen, Gnädiger Herr--
                                        Polonius.
Ja, oder trinken, fluchen, Händel machen, den ...
       nachlaufen--So weit dürft ihr schon gehen.
                                        Reinoldo.
  Aber das würde ja seiner Ehre nachtheilig seyn.
                                        Polonius.

                     Aber, warum, Gnädiger Herr--
                                        Polonius.
                        Warum ihr das thun sollt?
                                        Reinoldo.
         Ja, Gnädiger Herr, das wollt ich fragen.
                                        Polonius.

                                        Polonius.
                   So behüt euch Gott; lebt wohl.
                                        Reinoldo.
                             Mein Gnädiger Herr--
                                        Polonius.

                                        Reinoldo.
                     Das will ich, Gnädiger Herr.
                                        Polonius.
Und macht, daß er seine Musik fleissig exerciert.
                                        Reinoldo.
                             Wohl, Gnädiger Herr.

                                        Polonius.
Lebt wohl--Ha, was giebts, Ophelia?  Was wollt...
                                         Ophelia.

                                        Polonius.

                                        Polonius.
                               Was sagte er dann?

                                        Polonius.
                Das bin ich nicht, Gnädiger Herr.
                                          Hamlet.
   So wollt ich, ihr wäret so ein ehrlicher Mann.

               Wovon ist die Rede, Gnädiger Herr?
                                          Hamlet.

  Hier, liebster Prinz, was habt ihr zu befehlen?

                                          Hamlet.
         Ich meyne, meinen Kopf auf euerm Schooß?
                                         Ophelia.
                               Ja, Gnädiger Herr.

                                         Ophelia.
                 Ich denke nichts, Gnädiger Herr.

                                          Nichts.
                                         Ophelia.
              Ihr seyd aufgeräumt, Gnädiger Herr?
                                          Hamlet.

                                         Königin.

     (Polonius verbirgt sich hinter die Tapeten.)
                              (Hamlet tritt auf.)
                                          Hamlet.
                  Nun, Mutter, was ist die Sache?
                                         Königin.
    Hamlet, du hast deinen Vater sehr beleidiget.
                                          Hamlet.
 Mutter, ihr habt (meinen) Vater sehr beleidiget.
                                         Königin.
Kommt, kommt, ihr gebt mir eine verkehrte Antw...
                                          Hamlet.
        Sie schikt sich auf eine boshafte Anrede.
                                         Königin.
                  Wie, was soll das seyn, Hamlet?
                                          Hamlet.
                              Was wollt ihr dann?
                                         Königin.
                       Kennst du mich nicht mehr?
                                          Hamlet.

                                          Hamlet.

Was hast du im Sinn?  Du wirst mich doch nicht...
                                      Hülfe!  ho!
                    Polonius (hinter der Tapete.)
                                 Wie?  He, Hülfe!
                                          Hamlet.

                                        Polonius.
                   O, ich bin ein Mann des Todes.
                                         Königin.
                    Weh mir!  Was hast du gethan?
                                          Hamlet.
In der That, ich weiß es nicht: Ist es der König?
                                         Königin.
 O, was für eine rasche und blutige That ist das!
                                          Hamlet.

                                          Hamlet.
             Ja, Gnädige Frau, das war mein Wort.

                                         Königin.

                                          Hamlet.

                   Bey Kilian und Sanct Charitas,

                   Beym Hahn, es ist nicht recht.
              Sie sprach: Bevor ihr mich ertappt,
                       Verspracht ihr mir die Eh;
                Bey jener Sonn, ich hätts gethan,
                       Was gabst du dich umsonst?
                                           König.
       Wie lang ist sie schon in diesem Zustande?

                 Sein Bart war so weiß als Schnee

 Er ist weg, er ist weg, und wir seufzen umsonst;

                         Richter, habt gute Acht.
                                          Hamlet.
                           Kommt dann, mein Herr.
                                         Laertes.
                          Wohlan, Gnädiger Herr--
                                   (Sie fechten.)
                                          Hamlet.
                                          Einer--
                                         Laertes.
                                           Nein--
                                          Hamlet.
                             Thut den Ausspruch--
                                           Oßrik.
        Ein Stoß, und das ein ziemlich fühlbarer.
                                         Laertes.
                               Gut--Noch einmal--
                                           König.
Haltet ein--zu trinken!  Hamlet, diese Perle i...
               Gesundheit!--Gebt ihm den Becher--
(Trompeten und Pauken und mit Salve von Geschüz.)
                                          Hamlet.
Ich will diesen Gang erst ausfechten--Sezt ihn...
                                    (sie fechten)
       --Wohlan--wieder einen Stoß--was sagt ihr?
                                         Laertes.
             Gestreift, gestreift, ich gesteh es.
                                           König.
                        Unser Sohn wird gewinnen.

                                          Hamlet.
                                  Gütige Mutter--
                                           König.
                          Gertrude trinkt nicht--
                                         Königin.
Ich will, mein Herr; ich bitte euch um Vergebung.
                                König (vor sich.)
 Es ist der vergiftete Becher; nun ists zu spät--
                                          Hamlet.
Ich darf noch nicht trinken, Gnädige Frau; ein...
                                         Königin.
           Komm, laß mich dein Gesicht abwischen.
                                         Laertes.
     Diesesmal will ich ihm gewiß eins anbringen.
                                           König.
                              Ich glaub es nicht.
                             Laertes (bey Seite.)
        Und doch ist es fast gegen mein Gewissen.
                                          Hamlet.
Kommt, den dritten Gang, Laertes; ihr tändelt ...
gebraucht euch eurer äussersten Stärke; ich so...
                            nur zu sicher machen.
                                         Laertes.
                      Sagt ihr das?  Wohlan dann.
                                   (Sie fechten.)
                                           Oßrik.
                      Es hat noch keiner nichts--
                                         Laertes.
                                Da habt es dann--

                                          Hamlet.
                              Nein, noch einmal--
                                           Oßrik.
                    Seht zu der Königin hier, ho!
                                         Horatio.

                                         Laertes.

                                          Hamlet.
                          Was macht die Königin--
                                           König.
Es ist nur eine Ohnmacht, weil sie Blut gesehe...

    Pyrrho, Pyrrho feroz como o tigre da Hyreania
                   Não é isso--começa por Pyrrho.

         Mensageiro do mal, de Belzebut ministro,

          O guerreiro senil! Então, Troia abatida
     Parece haver sentido, os golpes derradeiros:
    Ao ver prostrado o rei exhaure-se-lhe a vida,
     Desabam sobre a base em chammas os outeiros,
  E o som cavo e profundo a Pyrrho fere o ouvido.
  Eis de repente o gladio, a grande altura erg...
      Já prestes a immolar a fronte alva, nevada,
         Do venerando rei, detem-se lá na altura.
     E Pyrrho assim parece um tyranno em pintura,
      Suspenso entre a vontade e a obra começada!
     Mas como, muita vez, pouco antes da procella
      Se faz como que ouvir um silencio que gela,
        Pára a nuvem no céu, o vento não retumba,
      E a terra a nossos pés é muda como a tumba;
             Subitamente após se vê no fundo baço
   Um raio que illumina e rasga o immenso espaço,
  Assim de Pyrrho a furia, instantes mal contida,
         Irrompe a completar a obra interrompida.
           Dos Cyclopes jamais caíram retumbantes
         Com remorso menor os malhos flammejantes

  Que sobre o nobre velho, ensanguentada, impura,
  De Pyrrho a espada ardente!... É finda a hor...

         Quem visse tanto horror, acaso concebêra

      Com certeza, e a rainha tambem. Não tardam.

                                           HAMLET

     Pedimos, para nós, toda a vossa indulgencia;

                                           HAMLET

                                    O REI DA PEÇA
           Trinta vezes de Phebo o carro luminoso
      De Tellus e Neptuno, o largo giro ha feito,
        E trinta vezes doze a lua, astro saudoso,
     De refrangida luz, á terra ha dado o preito,
  Desde que as nossas mãos, com mutuo amor se ...
        E as bençãos dHymeneu o sacro nó teceram.
                                 A RAINHA DA PEÇA
     Possamos lua e sol, ver outras tantas vezes,
       Antes que deste amor se rompa o doce laço;
   Mas seguem-se á ventura as maguas, os revezes,
      E vejo-vos caído, ha pouco, em tal cansaço,

                           Oh! basta, senhor, ...
      Seria um novo amor perfidia negra e infame.
      Amaldiçoado seja o dia em que outro eu ame!
          Embora justo e bom, segundo companheiro
  Não no acceita ninguem, sem ter morto o prim...
                                           HAMLET
                 Isto é absintho, e que absintho!
                                 A RAINHA DA PEÇA
     Poisque motivo arrasta a viuva ao casamento?
         Acaso um novo amor? um nobre sentimento?
      Um sordido interesse: e eu cravára no peito
       De meu morto senhor a ponta de uma espada,
      Cada vez que, olvidando a antiga fé jurada,
     Compartisse outro ser commigo o mesmo leito.
                                    O REI DA PEÇA
  Creio bem, que pensaes o que dizeis, se creio?!
  Mas quanta, oh! quanta vez, se quebra a acçã...
            Nasce a resolução escrava da memoria,
   Producto da violencia, é curta a sua historia.
   A fructa emquanto verde em qualquer ramo atura
       Mas, sem abalo algum, tomba apenas madura.
     Fatalmente olvidando o que a nós nos devemos
         Não pagâmos jámais, a divida esquecemos.
         O que durante a dor parece a eternidade,
     Mal extincta a paixão, cessa de ser vontade.
  O jubilo e o martyrio, ainda os mais completos,
      Destruindo-se a si, destroem seus decretos.
  Onde o prazer mais ri, mais chora a dor pung...
      Entristece a alegria, alegra-se a tristeza,
     Á causa mais subtil, ao mais leve accidente,
           E este um dom fatal da vária natureza.
        Passâmos pelo mundo, e nada aqui tem dura
       Que até o proprio amor muda com a ventura;
   Porque é problema ainda occulto aos pensadores
    Se dá o amor fortuna, ou se a fortuna amores.
    Um principe decáe? somem-se os que os adulam;
         Um mendigo se eleva? os amigos pullulam.
         Até aqui o amor seguiu sempre a fortuna;
  Quem não precisa encontra em toda a parte am...
    E quem precisa e pede, é lepra que importuna,
       Todos transforma e muda em feros inimigos,
          Mas para concluir, escuta o corollario:
  A vontade e o destino, andam tanto ao contrario
   Que o mais leve projecto é sempre letra morta.
       Assim crês, não terás jamais outro marido;
      Pois abra-me o sepulchro a sua eterna porta
       E tudo irá sumir-se em um perpetuo olvido.
                                 A RAINHA DA PEÇA
    Negue-me a terra o pão, e a luz o firmamento!
      O meu goso maior transforme-se em tormento!
  Minha esperança e fé tornem-se em negro infe...
       Seja a fome em prisão o meu futuro eterno!
  Não tenha eu, viva ou morta, o mais curto re...
        Se, viuva uma vez, tomar um outro esposo!
                                           HAMLET
           E se lhe acontecer violar o juramento?
                                    O REI DA PEÇA
      Solemne juramento!... Amor, deixa-me agora;
   Exhausta sinto a fronte, e bom grado entregára
            Os restos deste dia á paz consoladora
  Dos braços de Morpheu. Adeus! Oh! sempre car...
                                 A RAINHA DA PEÇA

  E a desgraça jamais entre nós dois se assent...
                                           HAMLET
                    Senhora, como acha esta peça?
                                         A RAINHA
 A rainha parece-me que faz demasiados protestos.
                                           HAMLET
             Mas dada a palavra, não póde faltar.
                                            O REI
   Conhece a peça? não contém nada reprehensivel?

                                          OPHELIA
              Vossa alteza faz o serviço do côro.

                        Entram a RAINHA e POLONIO
                                          POLONIO

          senhora, peço só que falle com firmeza.
                                         A RAINHA
Fallar-lhe-hei com firmeza, esteja descansado....
                    passos. (Polonio esconde-se.)
                                     Entra HAMLET
                                           HAMLET
                          Que me quer, minha mãe?
                                         A RAINHA
           Hamlet, offendeste gravemente teu pae.
                                           HAMLET
           Minha mãe offendeu gravemente meu pae!
                                         A RAINHA
                           Como insensato fallas.
                                           HAMLET
                     A rainha falla como culpada!
                                         A RAINHA
                     Que queres tu dizer, Hamlet?
                                           HAMLET
                                O que é, senhora?
                                         A RAINHA
                            Esqueces quem eu sou?
                                           HAMLET

               POLONIO (por detrás do reposteiro)
                          O que é! olá, soccorro!
                 HAMLET (desembainhando a espada)

                                         A RAINHA
                            Que fizeste, infeliz?
                                           HAMLET
Ignoro-o; seria o rei? (Levanta o reposteiro e...
                                        Polonio.)
                                         A RAINHA
               Que acto de crueldade e de sangue!
                                           HAMLET
De sangue; quasi tão reprehensivel, minha mãe,...

                 Mas, filho, a quem fallas assim?
                                           HAMLET
                          Não vê nada, minha mãe?
                                         A RAINHA
     Nada, senão tudo quanto existe nesta camara.
                                           HAMLET
                                    E nada ouviu?
                                         A RAINHA
        Cousa alguma, a não ser as tuas palavras.
